Lake Worth Beach, FL --- On March 28, the City of Lake Worth Beach will certify the results of the runoff election, and swear-in the newly elected District 4 commissioner, Reinaldo Diaz and re-elected commissioner for District 2, Christopher McVoy. This important event will take place in Bryant Park from 6:00-6:30pm.

Members of the public and press are invited and encouraged to attend. 

In addition to electing the new Commissioner for District 4, voters passed the four ballot questions asked of them.

Question 1 instating term limits begins with those elected during this most recent election and so both Commissioner McVoy and Commissioner Diaz will be subject to them.

Question 2 allows for a candidate to concede in the case of a run-off and thus remove the requirement for the runoff to happen. This change will go into effect for the next election.

Question 3 changed the City to single member district voting so in future elections residents will vote only for the candidate representing their district. The Mayor will continue to be elected by voters throughout the whole City.

Question 4 requires vacancy's on the commission to be filled no later than 24 hours before the opening of the qualifying period for the next city election. This change takes effect whenever thereâ€™s next a vacancy.
